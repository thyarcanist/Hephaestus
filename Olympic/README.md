# ARG with GenAI: Divinr

## Overview
**Divinr** is an Alternate Reality Game (ARG) that blends a decentralized social media experience with Generated AI (GenAI) content. It features a closed system where the game state is managed by a C++ backend, with the web front-end serving as the game's interactive monitor.

Players begin with an 'empty' profile on Divinr, a platform where gods and mortals mingle. Here, they can interact with GenAI-driven posts from various divinities, create their own content, and watch their profile evolve based on their interactions.

## Features
Users will be able to:
- **Interact with Posts**: Engage with GenAI-generated content, reflecting the whims and activities of the divinities.
- **Create Content**: Contribute to the social tapestry of Divinr by posting text and images.
- **Develop Profiles**: Start with a blank slate and develop your profile through interactions and posts.

## Game Logic
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: New posts should be periodically generated by GenAI personifying 'y' divinity.
- **Divine Interaction**: Profiles of 'y' divinities will interact with user-generated posts, fostering a sense of community and activity.
