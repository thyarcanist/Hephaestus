# ARG w/ GenAI


It's a decentralized social media app, closed system, the game state is managed with C++ and the game monitor is the web-front end.
The user will be able to:
      - Interact with posts on Divinr.
      - Create posts on Divinr.

Logic to implement:
      - Every 'x', a new post, should be generated by 'y' divinity.
      - 'y' profiles should also interact with the users posts.
